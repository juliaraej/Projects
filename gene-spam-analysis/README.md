# Gene Expression and Spam Email Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of dimension reduction and classification techniques in R on two datasets:

1. Gene Expression Data
   - Uses PCA and Sparse PCA to analyze gene expression patterns across 5 cancer types: BRCA, KIRC, COAD, LUAD, and PRAD.  
   - Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/401/gene+expression+cancer+rna+seq

3. Spam Email Dataset
   - Uses **PCA** and **SVM** (linear and radial kernels) to classify spam vs. non-spam emails.  
   - Dataset: https://hastie.su.domains/CASI_files/DATA/SPAM.html
